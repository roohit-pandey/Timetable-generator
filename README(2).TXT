How it works -

The script asks how many subjects you have and collects their names.  

It sets the days of the week and the time slots for classes and self-study.  

It automatically assigns subjects to slots throughout the week.  

Sunday is set aside as a holiday for revision or self-study.  

Finally, it prints the timetable in a clear format.
